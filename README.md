# EquityMirror (MirrorTrade Pro) — Static PHP Demo

A compact PHP + MySQL demo for a trade-mirroring platform (Master + Followers) with basic risk management.

## What you get
- Static PHP pages: login, dashboard, accounts, risk management, logs, settings.
- Simple authentication (Master and Followers). Default master credentials created by seeding: `master / password`.
- SQL schema at `sql/schema.sql` and an automatic dump generated at `sql/final_dump.sql` when you run the seeder.
- A seeding script at `scripts/seed.php` that creates master/followers, sample trades, risk settings and logs.
- Minimal styles and JS in `web/assets` so the site is ready to upload to a typical shared host (Hostinger, etc.).

## Quick setup (Hostinger friendly)
1. Edit `web/config.php` and set your database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS).
2. Upload the contents of the `web/` directory to your Hostinger public folder (e.g., `public_html/`).
3. Upload the SQL files in `sql/` to the server (via File Manager or phpMyAdmin) OR run the seeder on the host.

   Option A — Run seeder in the host (recommended):
   - Upload the whole repository (or at least `web/`, `sql/`, `scripts/`).
   - In a browser, visit `https://yourdomain.com/scripts/seed.php` OR run from SSH/CLI: `php scripts/seed.php`.
   - The seeder will create DB objects (if needed), seed data and write `sql/final_dump.sql`.
   - **Important:** Delete `scripts/seed.php` after running it for security.

   Option B — Use phpMyAdmin / MySQL:
   - Import `sql/schema.sql` to create the schema.
   - Optionally import `sql/final_dump.sql` (created by the seeder) to insert demo data.
Hostinger / Production DB credentials
- You can provide your Hostinger DB credentials by copying `web/db_credentials.php.example` to `web/db_credentials.php` and editing the constants there.
- The app will automatically load `web/db_credentials.php` if present and use those values instead of the defaults in `web/config.php`.
- Make sure `web/db_credentials.php` is NOT committed to source control (it's already ignored via `.gitignore`).
4. Open `https://yourdomain.com/` and login. (Default master credentials after seeding: `master / password`.)

## Files of interest
- `web/` — All front-end PHP pages and assets. This is what should be put into your public web root.
- `sql/schema.sql` — DDL to create the database schema.
- `scripts/seed.php` — Seeder script (run once, then remove).
- `sql/final_dump.sql` — Generated by the seeder (if you use it). Can be imported in phpMyAdmin.

---

## Security notes ⚠️
- The seeder writes plaintext passwords for the demo followers; **do not** leave the seeding script on a public site.
- Change the master password immediately in production.
- You should enable HTTPS and secure DB access credentials in `web/config.php`.

If you want, I can:
- Add a small admin page to rotate master password securely.
- Export a ready-made single SQL file with hashed passwords if you prefer a fully offline import.

Enjoy — upload and test, and tell me what features you'd like next (audit filters, CSV export, or webhook-based trade mirroring).
