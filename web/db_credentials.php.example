// Copy this file to `web/db_credentials.php` and update the constants with your Hostinger DB credentials.
// IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit your real credentials to source control. `web/db_credentials.php` is ignored by .gitignore.

// Example Hostinger settings:
define('DB_HOST', 'mysql123.hostinger.com');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_db_name_here');
define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user_here');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password_here');

// Optional: if your DB requires a specific port, you can define DB_PORT and edit `web/config.php` accordingly.
// define('DB_PORT', '3306');

// Save this file as `web/db_credentials.php` and confirm `web/config.php` will pick it up automatically.
